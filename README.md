# iup-porting
IUP is a multi-platform toolkit for building graphical user interfaces.
It was developed at Tecgraf by means of the partnership with PETROBRAS/CENPES.
It offers APIs in three basic languages: C, Lua and LED. 

The iup-porting is a maintenance project to make IUP a little bit easier to 
integrate into other project. It also hosts some test snippets.
I simply downloaded the IUP release package, made my own patches, built and 
tested some functions, then commit here.

The IUP details can be found at
http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/

The downloadable packages of IUP can be found at

In this page
https://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/
you may find the IUP is MIT License so iup-porting is set to MIT too.
